# palera1n-shortcut
palera1n integrated into shortcuts for a GUI.

# What is this? 
 This is the github repository for the palera1n shortcut.
The shortcut currently only supports Mac.

# When will it be released?
It should hopefully be released on August 8th or earlier.

# What benefits does this have over normal palera1n CLI?
It provides a GUI for palera1n, lets you choose your device to know what to do for your device, automaticlly pops up an alert on apple series chips to unplug and replug, and provides a seprate additional options menu to show you how to exit recovery mode and fix the issue if you are stuck on Booting, and more!

# How does it display the terminal output?
 Currently, it opens up a terminal window to show whats happening. Although, In the future there may be a betyer optioj but who knows.

# Why? 

I wanted to make something that I felt like would be helpful to the jailbreak community. Even though paleran could be easy to run, it may be challenging for certain people.
